Vaibhav, with your background in architectural and computational design, it sounds like you're adept at blending form, function, and narrative. And Sebastian, your interests in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) could add a dynamic interactive layer to traditional storytelling methods.\n\nHow do you think your fields can overlap in creating innovative narratives or experiences? Can you imagine combining interactive art or sculpture with architectural design to tell stories that engage audiences in new and immersive ways? It'd be fascinating to hear",
